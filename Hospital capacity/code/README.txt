## Tutorial: using Shiny + reticulate to create apps with R and Python 3

<br> 

The `reticulate` package from RStudio allows you to incorporate Python functions and scripts into your R code. Inspired by the many questions online around writing and deploying Shiny apps that use the `reticulate` package, I created this app as an end-to-end example.

#### In this tutorial, you will learn:

1. How to configure reticulate virtual environments for use locally and on shinyapps.io. (This example uses Python 3 but can be modified for Python 2, if desired.)

2. How to deploy a Shiny + reticulate app to shinyapps.io

3. How to confirm that your app deployed on shinyapps.io is using the desired version of Python

### About the demo app

**See it in action:** A live version deployed to shinyapps.io and using Python 3 can be seen [here](https://elasticlabs.shinyapps.io/shiny-reticulate-app/)!

The demo app example contains two tabs. The first tab demonstrates some R and Python functions being used to make a plot and print some text. The second tab displays a table summarizing the architecture information for the machine running the app.

### First-time set-up

#### Installing requirements

To clone this project, in a terminal, run:

  ```
  $ git clone https://github.com/ranikay/shiny-reticulate-app.git>
  $ cd shiny-reticulate-app/
  ```

Install Python and the required packages:

- Python >= 3.5

- Python packages: [virtualenv](https://virtualenv.pypa.io/en/stable/) and [numpy](https://numpy.org/)

  To install Python packages, in a terminal, run:

  ```
  $ pip install virtualenv
  $ pip install numpy
  ```
  
Install R and the required packages:

- R >= 3.6

- [RStudio](https://rstudio.com/products/rstudio/)

- R packages: [shiny](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/shiny/index.html), [DT](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/DT/index.html), [RColorBrewer](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/RColorBrewer/)

  To install the above packages, in the R console, run:

  ```
  > install.packages(shiny)
  > install.packages(DT)
  > install.packages(RColorBrewer)
  ```
  
- The R package [reticulate](https://rstudio.github.io/reticulate/). **Important notes**: the RStudio team has made some changes to `reticulate` recently, including [changes that enable Python 3 virtual environments on shinyapps.io](https://github.com/rstudio/reticulate/issues/399). Therefore, **you must currently use the development version of reticulate in order to deploy an app using Python 3 to shinyapps.io**. To install it, in the R console, run:

  ```
  > remotes::install_github("rstudio/reticulate", force = T, ref = '967a9a750e2f2e8ca61a9fe9fc3616bc63f97399')
  ```

- The R package [shinycssloaders](). To install, in the R console, run:

  ```
  > devtools::install_github('andrewsali/shinycssloaders')
  ```

<br>

#### Setting up the local virtual environment

- Now we'll move into RStudio. To open the project in RStudio, in the terminal, run: 

  ```
  $ open shiny-reticulate-app.Rproj
  ```

- In RStudio, we'll use the `reticulate` package to create a Python 3 virtualenv and install `numpy` into it. In the R console:

  ```
  > reticulate::virtualenv_create(envname = 'python35_env', 
                                  python= '/usr/bin/python3')
  
  Creating virtual environment 'python35_env' ...
  Using python: python3
  ...[more output]
  
  > reticulate::virtualenv_install('python35_env', 
                                   packages = c('numpy'))  # <- Add other packages here, if needed
                                   
  Using virtual environment 'python35_env' ...
  Collecting numpy
  ...[more output]
  Installing collected packages: numpy
  Successfully installed numpy-1.17.4
  ```
  
That's it for set-up! Now we're ready to run the app locally.

### Running and deploying

#### Running the app locally

In RStudio, open the file server.R and click **Run App** to view your app.

<p align="center">
<img src="https://cdn.brandfolder.io/TLCWDQBL/as/q1jwwt-3fnhuw-5qoay7/shiny-reticulate-app_screenshot_run_app.png" width="600">
</p>

<br>

For the Python functionality demonstrated on the first tab of the app, the app is using the virtual environment that we configured in the [Setting up the local virtual environment](#setting-up-the-local-virtual-environment) section. The app knows to use this virtual environment based on line 16 in server.R:  `reticulate::use_virtualenv('python35_env', required = T)`

While running the app, we can click on the **Architecture Info** tab to confirm that the app is using the correct version of Python.

<br>

#### Deploying to shinyapps.io

Deploying your app to shinyapps.io requires the `rsconnect` package and a shinyapps.io account. If you haven't deployed an app to shinyapps.io before, instructions for creating an account and configuring `rsconnect` can be found [here](https://docs.rstudio.com/shinyapps.io/getting-started.html).

Begin by running the app locally. In RStudio, open the file server.R and click **Run App** to view your app.

Click **Publish** in the upper right, confirm that the shinyapps.io account information is correct and name your app. Then click **Publish** in the pop-up window to send your app to the shinyapps.io cloud servers.

<img src="https://cdn.brandfolder.io/TLCWDQBL/as/q1sz52-ahuy0o-4mm0t0/Publish.png" width="600">
</p>

A successful deploy will produce a deployment log similar to this in the "Deploy" window in RStudio:

<p align="center">
<img src="https://cdn.brandfolder.io/TLCWDQBL/as/q1szho-9873s-42i0kc/Deploy.png" width="600">
</p>

<br>

After deploying, visit the url shown in the deployment log in your browser to view the app running on shinyapps.io. Go to the **Architecture Info** tab to confirm that the desired version of Python is being used. For [this tutorial app deployed to shinyapps.io](https://elasticlabs.shinyapps.io/shiny-reticulate-app/), this is Python 3.5.

### Troubleshooting

If you are having issues deploying your app to shinyapps.io, double check that you have completed all steps in the [first-time set-up](#first-time-set-up). Confirm that the .Rprofile file is included in your project's directory. This file sets the `RETICULATE_PYTHON` environment variable, which tells `reticulate` where to locate the Python virtual environment on the shinyapps.io servers.

If you visit the app url on shinyapps.io and see "Disconnected", log in to shinyapps.io and view the application logs for errors.

Some common issues and how to solve them:

**ERROR: The requested version of Python ('/usr/bin/python3') cannot be used, as another version of Python ('/usr/bin/python') has already been initialized.**

When you run `library(reticulate)`, the `reticulate` package will try to initialize a version of Python, which may not be the version that you intend to use. To avoid this, in a fresh session, run set-up commands *without importing the reticulate library* with the :: syntax like this, for example:

```
> reticulate::virtualenv_create(envname = 'python35_env', 
                                  python= '/usr/bin/python3')
```

Similarly, if you're setting the `RETICULATE_PYTHON` variable, you must do so *before* running `library(reticulate)`.

**My app is deployed to shinyapps.io but shows that it's using Python 2.7**

Confirm that the .Rprofile file is included in your project's directory and double-check the name of the virtual environment that the `RETICULATE_PYTHON` variable is pointing at. For example, in my .Rprofile file, we see:

```
# .Rprofile

Sys.setenv(RETICULATE_PYTHON = '/home/shiny/.virtualenvs/python35_env/bin/python')
```

The name of the virtual environment is `python35_env`. In server.R lines 11-12, we can see that the `python35` virtual environment was created using Python 3:

```
# server.R

reticulate::virtualenv_create(envname = 'python35_env', 
                                  python = '/usr/bin/python3')
```

To confirm that the virtual environment created is indeed using Python 3.5, we can also use the `py_config()` function in the `reticulate` package:

```
> reticulate::py_config()
python:         /Users/rani/.virtualenvs/python35_env/bin/python
libpython:      /Library/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/3.5/lib/python3.5/config-3.5m/libpython3.5.dylib
pythonhome:     /Library/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/3.5:/Library/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/3.5
virtualenv:     /Users/rani/.virtualenvs/python35_env/bin/activate_this.py
version:        3.5.0 (v3.5.0:374f501f4567, Sep 12 2015, 11:00:19)  [GCC 4.2.1 (Apple Inc. build 5666) (dot 3)]
numpy:          /Users/rani/.virtualenvs/python35_env/lib/python3.5/site-packages/numpy
numpy_version:  1.17.4

NOTE: Python version was forced by use_python function
```

**On shinyapps.io, I see the warning: using reticulate but python was not specified; will use python at /usr/bin/python Did you forget to set the RETICULATE_PYTHON environment variable in your .Rprofile before publishing?**

Confirm that the .Rprofile file is included in your project's directory and was deployed along with server.R and ui.R to shinyapps.io. This file sets the `RETICULATE_PYTHON` environment variable, which tells `reticulate` where to locate the Python virtual environment on the shinyapps.io servers.
